Need to develop Measurement Conversion using PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This application should converts different quantities like 
    - Area, 
    - Length (& Distance), 
    - (Mass &) Weight, 
    - Temperature, 
    - Volume (& Capacity), and 
    - Speed 
    from one unit to another. 
    
    - Also, there should be some validation in the project 
        - to make it more attractive and functioning.

Steps to develop:

1. There should be a menu on home screen as per the SS.

2. When any of the menu items clicks, it should redirect to Actual convert dropdown screen

3. There should be some validations applied for dropdown

Note: Develop any of 3 would be fine out of 6 measures from menu. 
    One can design menu by his/her choice. SS is given just for example.
